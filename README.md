# 6 advanced projects made in Java

## Subject
Technological Platforms

## Main goal
In my projects I mainly focused on
multithreading, multitasking, testing, mocking, automation, databases

## Tool
Apache Maven configured to use the Java platform version 11 or higher

## P1 - Collections
First basic project. It was mainly about become familiar with the topic of collections and interface. I used recursion to show the statistics of a given object  
## P2 - Threads
I implemented an application in text mode that allows for parallel execution of complex calculations. 
## P3 - Sockets
In this project I implemented an application in text mode allowing network communication of two independently run components - Server and Client. My code uses TCP for communication (java.net.Socket / ServerSocket). 
## P4 - Java Persistence API
I implemented entity classes and configuration of the persistence unit to automatically create tables. Ability to add new entries to the database with correct relationship settings. Deleting entries from the database.Displaying all entries from the database. Displaying the query result defined by the instructor. I used the Hibernate library.
## P5 - Unit Tests
I used Mockito, JUnit and AssertJ to finish this project. I seperated the code into three components: repository, service and controller. In my opionion, this one was the most interesting one :).
## P6 - Parallelizing operations
The application retrieves a list of files using the New File API. I implemented a pipeline that processes a stream of images from a given directory. Then the pipeline is parallelized and run within its own thread pool and tests how the application execution time changes depending on the pool size. The project has the shortest code tho it was the hardest one
